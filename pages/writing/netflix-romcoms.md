I have never been a big fan of romantic comedies. Although, as Lisa Bonos says in “Netflix Knows We Need An Escape,” watching two characters fall in love “releases pleasure and bonding hormones, effectively tricking my brain into feeling as though I’m the one experiencing this meet-cute and falling for you montage,” I don’t think my brain has ever been tricked this same way. When I watch romantic comedies, I feel embarrassed for the characters. The situations they find themselves in are cringey and they make me want to cover my eyes and only peek once the gooey stuff is over. Netflix is bringing about a renaissance of rom-coms, and based on my age and gender, I should be the perfect target audience. But most of the time, I only vaguely enjoy rom-coms, preferring the side plot more than the romance. When I was younger, one of my favorite movies was 13 Going On 30. As a child, I thought of it less as a rom-com and more as an exciting adventure story where a girl gets magically transported into her adult life; For me, the romantic plot was an added bonus rather than the focus of the film. Now, though I still enjoy the movie, I see the trope for unhappy people, especially women, to find romantic fulfillment by returning to childhood, even if they are quite literally still children as in 13 Going On 30. 

Romantic comedies teach audiences that happiness, love, and stability can be found by returning to the pre-sexual innocence of childhood. Women who are personally or professionally successful are shown as not truly happy. They find fulfillment not from work or personal growth, but from long-term romantic partnership and the life that comes with it. Leger Grinden in The Hollywood Romantic Comedy describes a common obstacle for lovers in a rom-com as the conflict between personal development and self-sacrifice. This is present in films like Notting Hill, where the life of successful movie star Anna Scott clashes with the quiet bookish life of William Thatcher. Ultimately, Anna makes the grand sacrifice of her professional life in Hollywood in order to move to London to be with William “indefinitely.” We see this same conflict in Netflix’s Always Be My Maybe. With her successful career as a celebrity chef, rather than being praised for her impressive professional life, Sasha is condemned for straying too far from her roots. Marcus shames her for being “too ambitious” and complains that she has won too many awards and lost track of her true self. The main conflict between Marcus and Sasha’s relationship is their incompatibility of lifestyles. Marcus wants Sasha to sacrifice her career to stay with him in San Francisco, while Sasha is unwilling to give up the life she has worked hard to build. 

As Grinden discusses, the “meet-cute” is also an important aspect of any romantic comedy. This first meeting, often fumbling and awkward, is quite different from love at first sight. It sets the scene for the story to grow, usually from an “enemies-to-lovers” situation as in Notting Hill and the re-introduction of Sasha and Marcus in Always Be My Maybe. What’s more, both Anna in Notting Hill and Sasha in Always Be My Maybe are already in committed relationships. Romantic comedies encourage audiences that “a true romantic connection can be formed even when one or both of the characters is married to or involved with someone else.” By seeing these representations of romantic love, audiences are encouraged to look for unhappiness or uncertainty in their own romantic relationships, to question whether or not they have found “the one.” The meet-cute and the depiction of true love being found even when it shouldn’t reminds me of Berger’s Ways of Seeing. Women are “split into two,” always aware of ourselves from two vantage points: our own eyes and the internal eyes of the imagined man who suddenly sees us and wants to love us. The logical and safe choice for partnership, as argued by rom-coms, is the wrong partner while relationships that are emotional, unpredictable, and impulsive are fated to be. 

Unrealistic depictions of love in romantic comedies are dangerous, not only because they teach audiences to look for irresponsible plotlines in their own lives, but because they reflect and shape the cycle of optimism and cynicism in public perception of relationships and affect how we understand who has access to such fabulous and unconditional love. As Kaufman explores in “Where Has the Romantic Comedy Gone? To Netflix,” increased interest in rom-coms is reflective of a larger cultural need for a lighthearted escape. The “mise-en-scène of luxury” as you call it, suggests a desire to forget one’s own class struggles by watching beautiful, wealthy people fall in love in front of “a pleasurably commodified backdrop.” Netflix rom-coms are reviving a genre that has been dismissed as “girly” and “uninteresting.” As Amy Nicholson argues in “How Set it Up and Netflix Resurrected the Modern Rom-com,” the film industry “gaslit women by claiming they don’t go to the movies” and began producing fewer and fewer “women’s films.” Netflix, with their advanced algorithms, however, noticed a desire for romance and they capitalized on the gap in the industry. More than that, while they are certainly not great classics, Netflix rom-coms are beginning to change the types of people and relationships we see in romantic comedies. Although it may not be my personal favorite genre, I can’t help but root for the underdog (especially one so often dismissed for being too feminine) and hope to see rom-coms continue to thrive.
