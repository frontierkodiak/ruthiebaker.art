Whether or not Walker Evans intended his work to have political connotations, his photograph of a graveyard and steel mill in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania undoubtedly reflects a mill worker’s link between life and death. If, as historian Warren Susman argues, Evans’ work was not meant to inspire social change but rather show “fundamental Americanism,” the photograph still shows an essential part of blue-collar American life. 

This photograph was taken in 1935 for the Farm Security Administration. Because Evans’ work was funded by the federal government, even if his own desire was to avoid political meaning, his images cannot be fully understood without recognizing the political association involved. Roy E. Stryker, who headed the government photography project, instructed many of the photographers to take more gloomy and depressing photographs. 

The photograph of the graveyard and the steel mill is especially glum. The image was taken with black and white film and has a wide depth of field with items both close up and far away in focus. The closest thing in the image, on the left side of the photograph, is a large white cross on top of a headstone. Many smaller gravestones and crosses are behind it. Even further back, telephone poles with similarly cross-shaped tops line the street. The back of the image shows many industrial chimneys from the mills and small houses that fade off in the distance. 

The intended audience of this image has always been the American public. This has not changed, only the method of circulation. Although Evans’ photograph was originally used in propaganda for the Farm Security Administration, it has become something of an iconic depiction of American life in the 1930s. It has been on display many times, including in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City[^1]. The image is also preserved publically in the Library of Congress. The site where the photograph was taken, at St. Michael’s Church in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, has even become a tourist location where the town’s historical society provides guided tours. 

Although there are no people visible in this photograph, the image conjures the presence of both the living and the dead who inhabit the space. One can assume there are people working in the factories, living in the houses, and resting in the graves. Seeing them so closely connected, both in physical distance and symbolically, walks the fine line between life and death. Perhaps it was never his intention, but Evans’ photograph does reflect the social status of American factory workers and cannot be completely understood or appreciated without considering any political purpose.
