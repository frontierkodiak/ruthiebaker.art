I'm an artist working in the spaces between photography and collage, poetry, and digital technology. I explore how analog photographic processes can be combined with other mediums to create something new and strange. Drawing on the repetitive, obsessive nature of my thoughts and the mundane experiences of daily life, I use text, numbers, patterns, and personal objects to examine themes of memory, tradition, self, and family. My work centers on the emotional significance of modest objects and interpersonal relationships, as well as the connection between human life, nature, and decay. I focus on the simple intimacies of life to dig deeper into my lineage and myself, and to better understand the world around me. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Film and Media Studies from Emory University and am currently pursuing my Masters of Fine Arts from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
